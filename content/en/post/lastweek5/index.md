## Labs

Last week was spent doing Lab works №11, №12 and a Personal Project. It was stressful but I had to overcome this in order to be better in my OC class. Because of my gard work I was able to finish everything in time. Also I finished a novel about 2 boyscouts in USSR, which was really interesting.
