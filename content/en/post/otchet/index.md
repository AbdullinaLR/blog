## Basic rules

- Title page. The first sheet of work is drawn up strictly according to the model that is usually given in methodological manuals for your subject. It does not just require you to specify elements such as the name of the educational institution, type of work and information about the performer, but also arrange them in strict accordance with the standards.

- Abstract. It must indicate the number of parts, pages of work, illustrations, applications, tables, used literary sources and applications. There is also a list of key words of the work and the actual text of the abstract. The latter implies the main elements of the work from the goals set to the results and recommendations for their implementation.

- Introduction. In the introduction of a typical laboratory work, the goals of the research being conducted and the tasks, the implementation of which will help to achieve the goals, are usually prescribed.

- Main part. It is important that this section of the work reflects its essence, describes the methodology and results of the work done.

The main part contains the following elements:
- the purpose of the study;
- tasks, the implementation of which will help to achieve the goals;
- the progress of work, which describes the actions performed;
- other sections provided for by methodological materials on the discipline under study.

- Conclusion. In this part of the work, you will need to draw conclusions on the results obtained during the laboratory work. To do this, evaluate how fully the tasks have been completed. Other elements may be present in complex works, for example, recommendations for further application of the results of the work done
