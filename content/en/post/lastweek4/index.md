## Labs

Last week was spent doing Lab works №8,№9 and a Personal Project. It was stressful but I had to overcome this in order to be better in my OC class. Because of my gard work I was able to finish everything in time. Also I was in cinema. It was a strange (and kinda cringe) but fun overall. Me and my friends had a good time.
