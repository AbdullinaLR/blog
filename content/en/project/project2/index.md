"Evening" is the debut collection of Anna Akhmatova, published in March 1912 in an edition of 300 copies by the publishing house "Workshop of Poets". He immediately drew the attention of critics of the Silver Age to the personality of the beginning poetess. Critics and readers unanimously noted the accuracy and expressiveness of Akhmatov's poetic style, the clarity and clarity of the artistic depiction of reality, the visibility and delineation of images, the soft inconsistency of the author's syntax. Mikhail Kuzmin left an interesting comment in the preface: “It seems to us that, unlike other lovers of things, Anna Akhmatova has the ability to understand and love things precisely in their incomprehensible connection with the minutes experienced. Often she accurately and definitely mentions some object (a glove on the table, a cloud like a squirrel skin in the sky, the yellow light of candles in the bedroom, a cocked hat in Tsarskoye Selo Park) seemingly unrelated to the whole poem, abandoned and forgotten, but it is from this mention that a more palpable prick, a sweeter poison, we feel. Without this squirrel skin, the whole poem, perhaps, would not have that fragile shrillness that it has […]”.

Descriptions of the state of mind of the lyrical heroine set a minor mood for the poem. The heroine recalls how she once felt both sadness and longing, but now she has lost this ability. Therefore, she calls herself a “toy”, compares with a cockatoo. In addition to sadness, one even feels some disappointment both in the “city of mysteries” and in oneself. "The hour before sunset": when darkness descends on the city, and a person is left alone with his thoughts and insomnia. "Wind from the sea": a symbol of lost liberty, purity, naturalness. “Go away”: there is already an echo of family relationships.

In the intonation, outwardly everyday, one can feel the expectation of a miracle. The ray of the sun, to which the heroine prays to him, became a symbol of hope, a mysterious promise of a happy future. In the morning, the heroine is immersed in thoughts, but in the evening she becomes cheerful, looking at the ray, which gives her hope and gives her peace. “Heart in half”: the feeling of a young gifted person at the dawn of life. The courses will soon be completed, and she already has a fiancé, also a poet. The colors in this poem are muted, even the beam is "pale, thin." She listens to herself and time, suffers, not knowing herself why. There are such outwardly inconspicuous moments when a person suddenly, with surprise, somehow especially clearly realizes that he lives, exists, that he also has a destiny and a path.

She left the front door unlocked in the hope that her chosen one would nevertheless change his anger for mercy and come to reconcile. But this, apparently, did not happen. Therefore, a woman who voices her thoughts in the poem in the first person, can only “watch how the stripes go out in the sunset darkness of the needles” and listen to the night rustles, hoping to distinguish among the conversations under the window the voice of the only person who is now more than anything in the world for her. want to see. She looks for a long time (sometimes with an unseeing look) at the surrounding nature, “sunset stripes”, shudders with secret joy if the sound of someone’s voice suddenly sounds strangely like the voice of a loved one. In the final quatrain, built on contrast, the poetess describes her mood swings: everything is lost, but she was sure that you would come. The paradoxical nature of this statement emphasizes the nervous, desperate intonation of the poem.

Thus, the psychological detail plays a significant role in creating the emotive space in A.A. Akhmatova. All the details help to better understand what the lyrical hero and the poetess herself are going through.
