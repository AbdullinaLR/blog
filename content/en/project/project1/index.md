The most important component of the information support of society, necessary for the safe existence and sustainable economic development of the state, is Earth remote sensing data (hereinafter referred to as satellite data). When studying large and hard-to-reach areas, they are of particular importance as a source of independent, objective and up-to-date information. In recent years, there has been rapid progress in the creation and development of means and technologies for remote sensing of the Earth. In addition, the number of launched satellites of high and ultra-high resolution is increasing every year. As a result, the resulting volume of data grows exponentially and is difficult to centrally store and process, while processing methods and algorithms are delayed due to the capabilities of new satellite sensors.

 In many environmental monitoring systems, satellite data and the results of their processing play a very important role. Therefore, almost all such systems today have devices for working with satellite data. To simplify the creation of such blocks and their subsequent operation, a special technology is being developed. One of its key elements is the technology for creating automated satellite data storage systems (hereinafter referred to as SSDS), which is discussed in the presented work.
 
 In the presented work, the main requirements for the functioning of the DSHS are formulated, the characteristics of satellite data archiving systems are analyzed, and the basic structure of the automated DSHS is considered. This technology can optimize the collection and storage of large amounts of data. In the future, the transition to adapted forms of information, which implies a standardized and thematic processing of "raw data", as well as their provision in the mode of network services. This design allows you to create truly distributed information systems (from local and completely autonomous to public), but requires the presence of nodes for processing, storing and transmitting data. Thematic data processing, which requires large computing power, should be carried out in specialized computing nodes.
